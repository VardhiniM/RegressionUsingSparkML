# Linear Regression Using Apache Spark
We will use Apache Spark to build a linear regression model to predict the "Yearly Amount Spent" by a person on an app based on featues such as
* Avg Session Length
* Time on app
* Time on website
* Length of membership
* Avatar color

We will use Avatar Color to understand how to map a categorical variable using One Hot Encoding in Spark
